# Financial Reporting Project
> This project was designed as a data pipeline to automate the process of extracting information from pdf reports to useful reporting data. 

# Process
1. The pipelines extract data from pdf documents sent throughout the organization. 
2. The pipelines then transform and normalize the data to match with data format. 
3. The pipelines then load the data into a PostgreSQL database which can be used by other applications for reporting

> Reporting is still under review for portfolio showcase.
